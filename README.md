Sometimes I want to find an image I know I've opened but have no idea of where I originally saw it

I made a Chrome extension to crudely display images from browser history for the sake of looking through them quicker.

To use:

* Clone the repo.
* Go to `chrome://extensions`.
* click `Load unpacked extension` and select the clone folder.
